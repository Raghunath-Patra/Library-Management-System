# Library-Management-System
A Summer of Innovation (IIT Dh) project.
## Description
This is our project which is based on creating a library management system using some HTML/CSS for the frontend part and JS and SQL framework for backend.With this webiste users which includes both the students and admins to monitor and organise their activities effortlessly and efficently. 
## Things it consits of:
1. Just a normal login page and a forgot password tag is also given which undergoes a one step verification.
#### student
1. Then we have Home page/main page where the user can explore the books of the library.
2. There is a profile for the student and a dashboard -giving an idea of his activities and also the pending submissions.
3. An issue page where a student can issue/re-issue withe the approval of admin on the availability of the book.
4. There are also E-books to access online.
#### Admin
Everything is similar to the the student interface, the things the differ are:
1. The admin-dashboard gets to monitorize the overall activity of the students and the books.
2. It gives the permission for the issue/re-issue of the books.
## Some add-ons:
1. There is a point reward system ,which encorages students in taking the books and submitting on time.
2. A student can comment or write a review about the books, also there is a like option.
